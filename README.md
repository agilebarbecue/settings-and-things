#AgileBarbecue settings

This is a collection of settings files or other stuff that we've worked on, created or tweaked, and is open source or public domain.

##Credits

The solarized dark scheme is based on the 'canonical' one at http://ethanschoonover.com/solarized - see the solarized license file also in this repository for details.

The noxisttf font is a TrueType version of the old nexus font by raster - http://www.rasterman.com - we can't find any licensing information but the original font was widely distributed and the TrueType version is therefore either in the public domain or similarly licensed. Please let us know if you think this is wrong.
